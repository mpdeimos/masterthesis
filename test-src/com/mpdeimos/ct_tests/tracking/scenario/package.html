This package contains a data driven clone tracing test framework.
Every folder in this package's test data directory contains a tracing scenario.
The name of the folder denotes the tracing scenario. 
The folder "add_subclone" for example tests a scenario where a part of an existing clone is again cloned.
<br/><br/>
Every tracing scenario folder contains <b>system version subfolders</b>. Every system version subfolder has all the code at a specific version.
System folder names must depict the date they represent following the pattern "yyyyMMdd". 
<br/><br/>
The expected clone tracing outcome is depicted in the file named <b>expectedresult.txt</b> in the tracing scenario folder.
<br/><br/>

Each line in the expectedresult file depicts a specific clone classes set. The string before the colon depicts
the clone report that contains the set. The after it denotes expected contained clone classes.

<pre>
clones-tracked.xml:CC(2), CC(2)
clones-removed.xml:
</pre> 

The above snippet for example expects the clones-tracked.xml report to be present and to contain 2 clone classes, each containing 2 clones.
Furthermore, it expects the clones-removed.xml report to be present, and expects it to be empty.
